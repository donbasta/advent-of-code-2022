# advent-of-code-2022

the plan is to use several languages altogether.
let's just start with the easy ones (python, c++, java, rust, golang, javascript)
then some other ones that i've at least learned (haskell, ocaml, pascal, kotlin, c#, ruby, prolog)

the target is to make sure that my pc can compile/run programs in those specified languages
and/or make a fresh installation, or the best practice
