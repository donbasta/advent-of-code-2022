# day 1

I started doing aoc on December 13th when there were already 13 problems available. My g++ installation was broken, realized this when I was going to join CF edu round a day earlier, so I decided to start with C++. Not much to do and learn except for installing fresh g++ using mingw.

# day 2

still using c++, breeze

# day 3

used python, got some WA because I forgot to remove the trailing whitespace from the input :dead:

# day 4

used python, no issue, breeze. should've brainfucked instead

# day 5

at first i was going to use java, but the problem statement of day 5 involves the terms cargo and crate, so yeah, this must be solved using the one and only rust. i've been learning rust since last several months, but well my rust is rusty (no pun intended), so i spend quite some time refreshing my rust here (getting input from file, parsing each line by line, even iterating over a vector :( )

# day 6

not much struggle since all of the rust-related struggles are mostly on the previous day. Oh, and this is Day6 btw, so coded this while listening to that band as well :D
