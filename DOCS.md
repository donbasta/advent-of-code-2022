# day 1

I started doing aoc on December 13th when there were already 13 problems available. My g++ installation was broken, realized this when I was going to join CF edu round a day earlier, so I decided to start with C++. Not much to do and learn except for installing fresh g++ using mingw.

# day 2

still using c++, breeze

# day 3

used python, got some WA because I forgot to remove the trailing whitespace from the input :dead:

# day 4

used python, no issue, breeze. should've brainfucked instead

# day 5

at first i was going to use java, but the problem statement of day 5 involves the terms cargo and crate, so yeah, this must be solved using the one and only: rust. i've been learning rust since last several months, but well my rust is rusty (no pun intended), so i spend quite some time refreshing my rust here (getting input from file, parsing each line by line, even iterating over a vector :( )

# day 6

not much struggle since all of the rust-related struggles are mostly on the previous day. Oh, and this is Day6 btw, so coded this while listening to that band as well :D

# day 7

we move to java. i think the last time i used java was when i did the game of life goacademy thing; more than one year ago. and turns out that i currently didn't have java installed on my pc bcs i factory resetted it at some point this year. so installing and configuring java became the most cumbersome thing to do for this day. and it was such a refreshing thing coding a data structure in java; if this was done in haskell instead i would've died.

whoa although haven't coded in java for years, fortunately I haven't forgotten lots of the syntaxes

# day 8

the only problem here is that should I solve the problem optimally by using some kind of min-stack? because brute force suffices... brute force it is
