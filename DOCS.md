# day 1

I started doing aoc on December 13th when there were already 13 problems available. My g++ installation was broken, realized this when I was going to join CF edu round a day earlier, so I decided to start with C++. Not much to do and learn except for installing fresh g++ using mingw.

# day 2

still using c++
