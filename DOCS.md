# day 1

I started doing aoc on December 13th when there were already 13 problems available. My g++ installation was broken, realized this when I was going to join CF edu round a day earlier, so I decided to start with C++. Not much to do and learn except for installing fresh g++ using mingw.

# day 2

still using c++, breeze

# day 3

used python, got some WA because I forgot to remove the trailing whitespace from the input :dead:

# day 4

used python, no issue, breeze. should've brainfucked instead

# day 5

at first i was going to use java, but the problem statement of day 5 involves the terms cargo and crate, so yeah, this must be solved using the one and only: rust. i've been learning rust since last several months, but well my rust is rusty (no pun intended), so i spend quite some time refreshing my rust here (getting input from file, parsing each line by line, even iterating over a vector :( )

# day 6

not much struggle since all of the rust-related struggles are mostly on the previous day. Oh, and this is Day6 btw, so coded this while listening to that band as well :D

# day 7

we move to java. i think the last time i used java was when i did the game of life goacademy thing; more than one year ago. and turns out that i currently didn't have java installed on my pc bcs i factory resetted it at some point this year. so installing and configuring java became the most cumbersome thing to do for this day. and it was such a refreshing thing coding a data structure in java; if this was done in haskell instead i would've died.

whoa although haven't coded in java for years, fortunately I haven't forgotten lots of the syntaxes

# day 8

the only problem here is that should I solve the problem optimally by using some kind of min-stack? because brute force suffices... brute force it is

# day 9

back to golang! not much struggle; breeze

# day 10

not much struggle again, except for the statement of the problem

# day 11

using typescript, doing some debugging hell, quite easy on the first part. the second part requires some kind of bigint for like an iteration of 10000 steps, but at step 400 it already reaches max bigint size :( lol i just need to find some kind of mathematical optimization to reduce the numbers using modulo. it quite takes some time since i need to go outside first touching some grass and playing basketball, but nothing major happened after that because turned out that i just need to find the LCM of all the divisibility constants of each monkey and reduce all the computations modulo that number
